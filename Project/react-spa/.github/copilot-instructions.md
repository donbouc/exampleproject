# React SPA Project

This is a React Single Page Application (SPA) with Material UI styling. The project is structured as follows:

- `src/components/`: Contains reusable components
- `src/components/layout/`: Contains layout components (Header, Footer, Layout)
- `src/pages/`: Contains page components
- `src/themes/`: Contains theme configuration
- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component with routing

The application features:
- Fixed header and footer with scrollable main content
- Material UI styling and components
- React Router for navigation
- TypeScript for type safety

When working with this codebase, please follow these guidelines:

1. Use Material UI components and styling system
2. Maintain TypeScript type safety
3. Follow component-based architecture
4. Use React Router for navigation
5. Ensure the header and footer remain fixed while only the main content scrolls
